# Baseball-Game

Game Design 1 Group Project

This was a group project about a baseball that needs to find its way back home.
In this game you play as a baseball and use physics and the mouse to launch yourself around the map to find your way back home.

The Design

This was a group project that I helped with coding and sound on. I helped with coding the physics and the teleportaion of the ball when it reached certain points.
